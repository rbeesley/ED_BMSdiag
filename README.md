Retrieve battery diagnostic data from your smart electric drive EV. Get a Status Report to rate the health of the battery or dig into more detailed measurements.  

>**Further documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/wiki).**

>**The development is now basically finished with the final release of v1.0.5 .**  

>**The software will only work on the third generation Smart electric drive vehicle build from late 2012 to mid 2015.**

>**You can buy a pre-assembled version of this tool. More information [here](http://www.sokoloff.com/smart451ED-BMS/).**

## You need
An Arduino with CAN bus shield to connect to the diagnostics port (OBDII-connector) of your car. Find information about usable [CAN-Shields here](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/wiki/CAN-Bus-Basics). If you have trouble getting a CAN connection please see the [Troubleshooting and Tips](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Tips) section.

Get the hardware and use an appropriate cable for the physical connection. See the schematics for making your own cable.

<p/>

## Get started
* Install PlatformIO into VSCode.

* Clone this repo into a folder. The folder structure used to look like this, but libraries have been moved to a lib directory and the include files have been moved to their own library:

* There is an external library dependency on Arduino's SD library which should be automatically installed by PlatformIO as part of the configuration.

* Open the ED_BMSdiag project and update the configuration to match the board you are using.

* Change the PIN configuration in ED_BMSdiag.h to reflect your board and shield configuration.

* Verify and Upload the project to the Arduino board.  

* **Find detailed installation instructions in: [english](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/wiki/Installation) | [german](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/wiki/Installation_DE).**

> **Verified to work with PlatformIO v3.3.3 (on Windows 10 - x64, Arduino R4 WiFi, and Seeed CAN Shield v2.0)**

## Usage >on your own risk<
Connect the CAN shield to the OBDII-connector and power up the car.

This simple tool will display the diagnostics via a serial USB connection. The readout will be started by entering commands after the prompt. See the [Wiki for further details of the CLI](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/wiki/Command-Line-Interface).


>**You need to open the serial port to configure the first time. Verify that the port is set to 115200-8-n-1.**
